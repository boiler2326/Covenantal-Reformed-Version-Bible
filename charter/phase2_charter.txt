Phase-2 Charter: Cadence, Beauty, and Recognizability
Purpose:
Phase-2 exists to refine expression, not meaning. No semantic change is permitted.
I. Scope Limitation
Phase-2:
Operates only on pre-approved verse lists
Does not retranslate Hebrew
Does not introduce interpretive novelty
Phase-1 translation decisions are binding.
II. Governing Principles
No Meaning Drift
No added theology
No removed theological weight
No interpretive paraphrase
Recognizability Preference
Where a verse is historically memorized, prefer its historic English shape
Especially in Genesis 1, 3, 12, 15, 22, 49
Cadence over Novelty
Prefer time-tested phrasing
Avoid cleverness
Avoid over-explanation
KJV-Inspired, Not KJV-Imitative
No thee/thou/ye
But allow:
inversion
parallelism
elevated connective language
III. Explicit Allowed Adjustments
✔ Word order adjustments
✔ Synonym swaps where meaning is unchanged
✔ Removal of redundant explanatory phrases
✔ Restoration of classic idioms
IV. Explicit Prohibitions
✘ No doctrinal reinterpretation
✘ No gender-neutralization
✘ No stylistic modernization
✘ No smoothing away repetition that signals emphasis
V. Hard Locks (Non-Negotiable)
Seed (Gen 3:15)
In the beginning
Let there be light
Covenant continuity terms:
everlasting
offspring / seed
oath language
VI. Output Rule
Phase-2 output must be:
stylistically improved
semantically identical
backward-compatible with Phase-1 references
3) Explicit Implementation Instructions
This is the most important part — how to do Phase-2 without breaking everything.
