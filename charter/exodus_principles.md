# Exodus Translation Principles
(Covenantal Reformed Version)

This document records the binding translation and editorial principles
applied to the Book of Exodus.

Unless explicitly modified below, all principles documented in
`genesis_principles.md` remain in force.

---

## 1. Divine Names (Central Exodus Distinction)

### 1.1 The Divine Name (YHWH)
- The tetragrammaton (YHWH) is rendered as **LORD** (all caps).
- “the LORD” is used in narrative and speech.
- Mixed forms (e.g., “Lord God”) are avoided unless the Hebrew explicitly
  combines divine titles (e.g., YHWH Elohim).

### 1.2 LORD vs God (Elohim)
- “God” is used where the Hebrew is *Elohim* without YHWH.
- “the LORD” is preferred in covenantal, redemptive, and revelatory contexts.
- Repetition is preserved when the Hebrew is emphatic.

Exodus is allowed to *sound weighty and repetitive* where the Hebrew
intends solemnity.

## 2. Reverential Pronouns (Reaffirmed)

### 2.1 Capitalization Rules
Pronouns referring directly and unambiguously to God are capitalized
(He, Him, His, Himself).

Capitalization is applied only when:
- God is the sole subject or speaker
- No human antecedent intervenes
- The referent is unmistakable in context

### 2.2 Human Referents
Pronouns referring to:
- Moses
- Pharaoh
- Israel
- elders
- individuals or groups

are always lowercase, regardless of proximity to divine speech.

Example:
> “And the LORD said to Moses, ‘Stretch out your hand…’ and **he** stretched it out.”

---

## 3. Divine Speech and Weight of Repetition

Exodus contains extended divine speech, commands, and self-revelation.

Editorial principle:
- Do **not** over-smooth divine speech
- Do **not** collapse repetition into pronouns when the repetition carries
  authority or solemnity

Example:
> “And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying…”

This formula is preserved throughout Exodus and not stylistically reduced.

---

## 4. Covenant and Redemption Language

### 4.1 “My people”
- Rendered plainly and consistently
- Capitalization is not used to signal theology
- Possessive force is preserved through phrasing, not formatting

### 4.2 “Redeem / Redemption”
- Terms are rendered literally
- No interpretive expansion in the base text
- Later theological richness is not imported retroactively

---

## 5. Signs, Wonders, and Agency

When both divine and human agency appear in a verse:

- Divine action is not minimized
- Human obedience is not overstated
- Pronouns track **actor**, not theological importance

Example:
> “And Moses lifted up the staff… and the LORD brought a strong east wind…”

Both agents are preserved without grammatical confusion.

---

## 6. Angel of the LORD (Exodus-Specific Clarification)

- “angel” remains lowercase
- “the LORD” remains uppercase
- Pronouns are capitalized only when the angel speaks explicitly as God
  (first-person divine speech), not merely because of later interpretation

Ambiguity is allowed to remain where the text itself is ambiguous.

---

## 7. Law-Giving Context (Exodus 19–24)

### 7.1 Tone
- Formal
- Solemn
- Elevated but readable

No casual modern phrasing is introduced into legal material.

### 7.2 Direct Address
When God addresses Israel directly:
- Pronouns are capitalized only when referring to God
- Second-person address remains lowercase (“you”), consistent with Genesis rules

---

## 8. Theological Restraint (Reaffirmed)

- Exodus is not harmonized forward into Deuteronomy or the Prophets
- Typology (Passover, Exodus, mediator language) is not signaled by
  capitalization or stylistic markers
- Interpretation belongs to study notes, not the translation text

---

## 9. Editorial Status

Upon completion of Exodus:
- Divine-name usage must be internally consistent
- Pronoun capitalization must follow actor clarity
- Repetition must reflect Hebrew emphasis, not English impatience
