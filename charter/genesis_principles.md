# Genesis Translation Principles
(Covenantal Reformed Version)

This document records the binding translation and editorial principles
applied to the Book of Genesis. These decisions are considered final
unless compelling textual evidence requires revision.

## 1. Reverential Pronoun Capitalization

### 1.1 Divine Pronouns
Pronouns referring directly and unambiguously to God are capitalized
(He, Him, His, Himself).

Capitalization is applied only when:
- God is the sole or unmistakable subject
- No human antecedent intervenes
- The referent is clear within the immediate clause

Capitalization is NOT applied merely because:
- God is mentioned earlier in the verse
- God is the speaker but the pronoun refers to a human object

### 1.2 Human Pronouns
Pronouns referring to humans (Adam, Noah, Abram, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
their descendants, or mankind generally) are always lowercase,
regardless of proximity to divine names.

This includes cases where:
- God is speaking about a human
- A divine action precedes a human referent

Example:
> “And the LORD God took the man and put **him** in the garden…”

## 2. Collective Nouns and Pronoun Agreement

### 2.1 “Seed” (zeraʿ)
The Hebrew noun *zeraʿ* (“seed”) is treated as a collective noun.

Capitalization rule:
- “Seed” is capitalized ONLY in Genesis 3:15
- All other occurrences are lowercase (“seed”)

Rationale:
- Genesis 3:15 uniquely narrows the referent by grammar and contrast
- All other occurrences are corporate, genealogical, or national
- Later Christological interpretation (e.g., Galatians 3) is not
  retrojected into the Genesis base text

### 2.2 Pronouns Following “Seed”
When pronouns refer back to “seed”:
- Singular masculine pronouns may appear due to Hebrew grammar
- These pronouns remain lowercase (his, him)
- Capitalization is never used in these constructions

Example:
> “…your seed shall possess the gate of **his** enemies.”

## 3. Divine Name Repetition vs Pronoun Use

### 3.1 Narrative Cadence
When “God” or “the LORD” appears twice in close succession within a
single sentence or clause, English cadence often prefers a pronoun
on the second reference.

General guideline:
- First reference: “God” / “the LORD”
- Second reference: “He”

This smoothing is applied when:
- God is the sole actor
- No ambiguity is introduced

This smoothing is NOT applied when:
- Multiple subjects are present
- Repetition is rhetorically or theologically intentional

## 4. Angel of the LORD

- “angel” remains lowercase
- “the LORD” remains uppercase
- Pronouns are capitalized only if the referent is clearly divine
  speech or action, not merely proximity to the title

---

## 5. Theological Restraint

The Genesis text is allowed to speak in its own historical and narrative
register.

- Christological significance is preserved where the text itself
  signals it (Genesis 3:15)
- Later theological development is not imposed through capitalization
  or pronoun choices
- Interpretation is reserved for study notes, not the base translation

## 6. Editorial Status

As of this document:
- Genesis 1–50 is editorially locked
- Pronoun capitalization and “seed” usage are final
- Future revisions must cite clear textual or grammatical necessity
