PHASE 3: POETIC & LITURGICAL PRESERVATION PASS

Purpose:
This pass exists to preserve beauty, cadence, memorability, and oral-readability
in poetic and liturgical portions of Scripture.

Guiding Principles:
- These texts are frequently read aloud, memorized, sung, or quoted.
- Recognition and historic resonance in English matter alongside faithfulness.
- Parallelism, rhythm, and line balance take priority over modern smoothing.
- When multiple faithful renderings exist, prefer phrasing closest to historic
  English ecclesiastical usage (especially where broadly remembered).

Constraints:
- Do NOT introduce archaic pronouns (thou/thee/thy).
- Mild older constructions (e.g., “I shall not want”) are acceptable if widely
  recognized and faithful.
- Do NOT add commentary, headings, or verse numbers.
- Do NOT alter meaning, imagery, or theological emphasis.

Specific Instructions:
- Preserve parallel lines; avoid collapsing poetry into prose.
- Favor shorter clauses over explanatory expansions.
- Where KJV phrasing is widely memorized and faithful, allow it to guide cadence
  (without copying).
- Optimize for spoken English, not academic analysis.

Output:
- Output ONLY the revised verse text.
- One verse per line, no line breaks inside a verse.
