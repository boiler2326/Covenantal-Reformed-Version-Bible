PHASE-2 ENFORCEMENT CHARTER (Cadence & Consistency)

Purpose
- Enforce project-wide consistency rules after Phase-2 polishing.
- These rules are deterministic: apply the same way every time.
- No semantic changes are permitted; enforcement is limited to formatting, casing, and a small set of approved idiomatic calque fixes.

Scope
- Applies to Phase-2 outputs only (output_phase2/*.jsonl).
- Operates verse-by-verse on the English translation field.

ENFORCEMENT RULES (Deterministic)

Rule E1 — Divine Name Consistency
- Render YHWH as LORD (all caps).
- In practice: the token "LORD" must be consistent within formulaic phrases.
- If a verse contains "angel of the LORD", do NOT permit "angel of the Lord" in the same referent context.

Rule E2 — Reverential Pronoun Capitalization (ON)
- When a third-person pronoun clearly refers to God, capitalize:
  He, Him, His, Himself
- Maintain capitalization already present.
- Do not capitalize pronouns that refer to men, angels, nations, idols, or ambiguous antecedents.

Rule E3 — Approved Calque Correction (“between … and …”)
- Replace wooden calques of the pattern:
  "separated between X and Y"
  with:
  "separated X from Y"
- Likewise:
  "to divide between X and between Y" -> "to divide X from Y"
- This is approved as an English idiom correction that preserves the Hebrew sense while restoring recognizability and beauty.

Rule E4 — Compound Number Readability
- In spelled-out compound numbers, do not use “and” inside the number:
  "three hundred sixty and five" -> "three hundred sixty-five"
  "nine hundred ninety and nine" -> "nine hundred ninety-nine"
- Keep "and" in constructions like "hundred and twenty" ONLY if the project’s chosen style explicitly permits it. (Default: do not insert 'and' unless already present in Phase-1.)

Rule E5 — Seed Capitalization Policy (Messianic/Redemptive Line)
- Capitalize Seed when it denotes the redemptive line (protoevangelium and Abrahamic promise trajectory).
- Keep seed lowercase for ordinary biological/agricultural meaning.
- Do not allow mixed casing for the same covenant-promise sentence.

Validation & Failure Policy
- If enforcement cannot be applied safely (e.g., ambiguous pronoun antecedent for E2), do not guess: leave the text unchanged and emit a WARNING log entry.
- If after enforcement a verse contains both "angel of the LORD" and "angel of the Lord", FAIL the run (hard error), as this undermines scholarly credibility.

Output
- The enforcement step MUST output valid JSONL with the same verse refs.
- Enforcement MUST NOT add headings, footnotes, or verse numbers.
