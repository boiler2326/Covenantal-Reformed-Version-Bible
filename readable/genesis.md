# genesis (CRV)


## Chapter 1

**1** In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
**2** And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
**3** And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
**4** And God saw the light, that it was good; and He separated the light and the darkness.
**5** And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
**6** And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate waters from waters.”
**7** And God made the expanse, and separated the waters that were under the expanse and the waters that were above the expanse; and it was so.
**8** And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
**9** And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.
**10** And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
**11** And God said, “Let the earth sprout grass, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind, whose seed is in them, upon the earth.” And it was so.
**12** And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed according to its kind, and tree bearing fruit whose seed is in it, according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
**13** And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
**14** And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years.”
**15** And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth; and it was so.
**16** And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.
**17** And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.
**18** to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
**19** And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
**20** And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the heavens.”
**21** And God created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
**22** And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird multiply on the earth.”
**23** And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
**24** And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creature according to its kind: livestock, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth according to its kind.” And it was so.
**25** And God made the living creature of the earth according to its kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
**26** And God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
**27** And God created the man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
**28** And God blessed them, and He said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that creeps on the earth.”
**29** And God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with fruit of a tree yielding seed; it shall be for you for food.”
**30** And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth in which is a living soul, I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.
**31** And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

## Chapter 2

**1** Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their host.
**2** And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
**3** And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God created to make.
**4** These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heavens.
**5** And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.
**6** But a mist would go up from the earth and water the whole face of the ground.
**7** Then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.
**8** And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there He put the man whom He had formed.
**9** And the LORD God caused to spring up from the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
**10** And a river went out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided and became four heads.
**11** The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that circles all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.
**12** And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
**13** And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that circles all the land of Cush.
**14** And the name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
**15** And the LORD God took the man and set him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.
**16** And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden you may surely eat.”
**17** But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you shall surely die.
**18** And the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make for him a helper corresponding to him.”
**19** And the LORD God formed from the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
**20** And the man called names for all the cattle, and for the birds of the heavens, and for every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper corresponding to him.
**21** And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.
**22** And the LORD God built the rib that He had taken from the man into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
**23** Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because from Man this one was taken.”
**24** Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
**25** And the two of them were naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed.

## Chapter 3

**1** Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And He said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”
**2** And the woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.”
**3** But from the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, “You shall not eat from it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.”
**4** And the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die.”
**5** For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
**6** And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise; and she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.
**7** Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made for themselves coverings.
**8** And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
**9** And the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
**10** He said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself.”
**11** And He said, “Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”
**12** The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.
**13** And the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
**14** And the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all the cattle and above every beast of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.”
**15** And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.
**16** To the woman he said, “I will surely multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you shall bear sons. And your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”
**17** And to Adam he said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.”
**18** And thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the herb of the field.
**19** By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.
**20** And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
**21** And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.
**22** Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest He stretch out His hand and also take from the tree of life and eat, and live forever—”
**23** So the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
**24** So he drove out the man, and he stationed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim and the flaming sword that turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

## Chapter 4

**1** Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, “I have gotten a man with the LORD.”
**2** And she again bore his brother, Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a worker of the ground.
**3** And in the course of days Cain brought from the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
**4** And Abel also brought, from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. And the LORD regarded Abel and his offering.
**5** But to Cain and to his offering he did not look with favor. And Cain burned with great anger, and his face fell.
**6** And the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?”
**7** If you do well, will there not be lifting up? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.
**8** And Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
**9** And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And He said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”
**10** And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground.”
**11** And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
**12** When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; a fugitive and a wanderer you will be in the earth.
**13** Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.”
**14** Behold, today you have driven me away from the face of the ground, and from your face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth, and it will be that whoever finds me will kill me.
**15** And the LORD said to him, “Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the LORD set a mark on Cain, so that no one finding him would strike him.
**16** And Cain went out from before the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
**17** And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he was building a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
**18** And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
**19** And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
**20** And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
**21** And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the father of all who handle the lyre and pipe.
**22** And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, a forger of every cutting tool of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
**23** And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, “Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: for I have killed a man for wounding me, and a boy for striking me.”
**24** For if Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
**25** And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, “For God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
**26** And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.

## Chapter 5

**1** This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God He made him.
**2** Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name Man in the day they were created.
**3** And Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and fathered a son in his likeness, according to his image, and he called his name Seth.
**4** And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were eight hundred years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**5** And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, and he died.
**6** And Seth lived one hundred five years, and fathered Enosh.
**7** And Seth lived after he fathered Enosh eight hundred seven years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**8** And all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, and he died.
**9** And Enosh lived ninety years and fathered Kenan.
**10** And Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**11** And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
**12** And Kenan lived seventy years and fathered Mahalalel.
**13** And Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**14** And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
**15** And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years and fathered Jared.
**16** And Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared eight hundred thirty years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**17** And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, and he died.
**18** And Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years and fathered Enoch.
**19** And Jared lived after he fathered Enoch eight hundred years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**20** And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, and he died.
**21** And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and fathered Methuselah.
**22** And Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah three hundred years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**23** And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
**24** And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.
**25** And Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and he fathered Lamech.
**26** And Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**27** And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, and he died.
**28** And Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and he fathered a son.
**29** And he called his name Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, from the ground which the LORD has cursed.”
**30** And Lamech lived after he fathered Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**31** And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, and he died.
**32** And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Chapter 6

**1** And it came to pass, when man began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
**2** The sons of God saw that the daughters of man were good in appearance, and they took wives for themselves from all whom they chose.
**3** And the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not contend with man forever, for he also is flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.”
**4** The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
**5** And the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of His heart was only evil continually.
**6** And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him to His heart.
**7** And the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, from man to beast, to creeping thing and to the birds of the heavens, for I am grieved that I have made them.”
**8** But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
**9** These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generations. Noah walked with God.
**10** And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
**11** And the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
**12** And God saw the earth, and behold, it was ruined, for all flesh had ruined its way upon the earth.
**13** And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.”
**14** Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and you shall cover it inside and outside with pitch.
**15** And this is how you shall make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
**16** You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and you shall set the door of the ark in its side; with lower, second, and third stories you shall make it.
**17** And behold, I am bringing the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish.
**18** But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall enter the ark—you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
**19** And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every kind you shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
**20** Of the bird after its kind, and of the beast after its kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you to keep them alive.
**21** And you, take for yourself of every food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be for you and for them for food.
**22** And Noah did according to all that God commanded him; so he did.

## Chapter 7

**1** And the LORD said to Noah, “Enter, you and all your household, into the ark, for you I have seen to be righteous before Me in this generation.”
**2** Of every clean animal you shall take for yourself seven and seven, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean, two, a male and his female.
**3** Also of the birds of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
**4** For in yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out every living thing that I have made from upon the face of the ground.
**5** And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
**6** Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
**7** And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark because of the waters of the flood.
**8** Of the clean animals, and of the animals that are not clean, and of the birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
**9** Two by two they came to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
**10** And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
**11** In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day all the fountains of the great deep were split open, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
**12** And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
**13** On that very day Noah came, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.
**14** They and every living thing after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every wing.
**15** And they came to Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
**16** And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
**17** And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it was raised high above the earth.
**18** And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
**19** And the waters prevailed exceedingly, exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that are under all the heavens were covered.
**20** Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered.
**21** And all flesh perished that moves upon the earth, birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind.
**22** All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
**23** And He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, from man to beast to creeping thing and to the birds of the heavens, and they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
**24** And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.

## Chapter 8

**1** And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.
**2** And the fountains of the deep were shut, and the windows of the heavens, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.
**3** And the waters receded from upon the earth, going and returning, and the waters diminished at the end of a hundred and fifty days.
**4** And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
**5** And the waters kept receding until the tenth month; in the tenth, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
**6** And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made.
**7** And he sent forth the raven, and it went out, going out and returning, until the waters were dried up from upon the earth.
**8** And he sent forth the dove from him, to see if the waters had abated from upon the face of the ground.
**9** But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him, to the ark, for the waters were on the face of all the earth. And he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark.
**10** And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
**11** And the dove came to him at evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters had abated from upon the earth.
**12** And he waited yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return again to him anymore.
**13** And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the waters were dried from upon the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried.
**14** And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
**15** And God spoke to Noah, saying,
**16** Go out from the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.
**17** Every living thing that is with you, of all flesh—of the bird and of the beast and of every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—bring out with you, and let them swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.
**18** And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.
**19** Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, according to their families, went out from the ark.
**20** And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
**21** And the LORD smelled the soothing aroma, and the LORD said in His heart, “I will not again curse the ground anymore because of man, for the inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; and I will not again strike down every living thing as I have done.
**22** While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.

## Chapter 9

**1** And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.”
**2** And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon all that creeps on the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are given.
**3** Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as the green plant, I have given you everything.
**4** Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
**5** And surely your blood of your lives I will require; from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man. From the hand of every man, his brother, I will require the life of man.
**6** Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man.
**7** And you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm on the earth and multiply in it.
**8** And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
**9** And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you.
**10** and with every living creature that is with you, the bird, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth
**11** And I establish My covenant with you, and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the waters of the flood, and there shall never again be a flood to destroy the earth.
**12** And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I am giving between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for everlasting generations.”
**13** I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
**14** And it shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.
**15** And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
**16** And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth.
**17** And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
**18** And the sons of Noah who went out from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.
**19** These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was dispersed.
**20** And Noah, a man of the soil, began and planted a vineyard.
**21** And he drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent.
**22** And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
**23** Then Shem and Japheth took the garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
**24** And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him.
**25** And he said, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brothers.”
**26** And he said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; and let Canaan be their servant.”
**27** May God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be their servant.
**28** And Noah lived after the flood three hundred years and fifty years.
**29** And all the days of Noah were nine hundred years and fifty years, and he died.

## Chapter 10

**1** Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood.
**2** The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
**3** And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
**4** And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
**5** From these the coastlands of the nations were separated in their lands, each according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations.
**6** And the sons of Ham: Cush and Egypt and Put and Canaan.
**7** And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
**8** And Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be a mighty man in the earth.
**9** He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”
**10** And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Akkad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
**11** From that land Asshur went out and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah.
**12** and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
**13** And Mizraim fathered the Ludim and the Anamim and the Lehabim and the Naphtuhim.
**14** and the Pathrusim and the Casluhim (from whom came forth the Philistines) and the Caphtorim.
**15** And Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn, and Heth.
**16** and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite
**17** and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite
**18** and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were dispersed.
**19** And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza, as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
**20** These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
**21** Also to Shem, the father of all the sons of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
**22** The sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
**23** And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
**24** And Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.
**25** And to Eber two sons were born: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan.
**26** And Joktan fathered Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah.
**27** and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
**28** Obal and Abimael and Sheba.
**29** and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
**30** And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
**31** These are the sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
**32** These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided in the earth after the flood.

## Chapter 11

**1** And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
**2** And as they journeyed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they settled there.
**3** And they said each to his fellow, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And the brick was to them for stone, and the tar was to them for mortar.
**4** And they said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.”
**5** And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had built.
**6** And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and now nothing that they plan to do will be withheld from them.”
**7** Come, let Us go down there and confuse their language, so that no man will understand the language of his neighbor.
**8** So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.
**9** Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth, and from there the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth.
**10** These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old and fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
**11** And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad five hundred years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**12** And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and fathered Shelah.
**13** And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah four hundred and three years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**14** And Shelah lived thirty years and fathered Eber.
**15** And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber four hundred three years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**16** And Eber lived thirty-four years and fathered Peleg.
**17** And Eber lived after he fathered Peleg thirty years and four hundred years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**18** Peleg lived thirty years and fathered Reu.
**19** And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu two hundred and nine years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**20** And Reu lived thirty-two years and fathered Serug.
**21** And Reu lived after he fathered Serug two hundred and seven years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**22** And Serug lived thirty years and fathered Nahor.
**23** And Serug lived two hundred years after he fathered Nahor, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**24** And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and fathered Terah.
**25** And Nahor lived after he fathered Terah one hundred and nineteen years, and he fathered sons and daughters.
**26** And Terah lived seventy years and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
**27** Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot.
**28** And Haran died in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
**29** And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
**30** Now Sarai was barren; she had no child.
**31** And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram his son, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; and they came as far as Haran and settled there.
**32** And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

## Chapter 12

**1** Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your land and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.”
**2** And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing.
**3** And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
**4** So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
**5** And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the persons whom they had made in Haran; and they went out to go to the land of Canaan, and they came to the land of Canaan.
**6** And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
**7** And the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your seed I will give this land.” And he built there an altar to the LORD who had appeared to hhhhhim.
**8** And he moved from there to the hill country, east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
**9** And Abram journeyed on, going and journeying toward the Negev.
**10** And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
**11** And it came to pass, when he drew near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “Behold now, I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance.”
**12** And it will be, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, “This is his wife,” and they will kill me, but you they will let live.
**13** Say, I pray you, that you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and my life may be spared for your sake.
**14** And it came to pass, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.
**15** And the princes of Pharaoh saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
**16** And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had flocks and herds, and donkeys and male servants and female servants, and female donkeys and camels.
**17** And the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
**18** And Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she is your wife?”
**19** Why did you say, “She is my sister,” so that I took her for myself as wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her and go.
**20** And Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

## Chapter 13

**1** And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him, into the Negev.
**2** Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
**3** And he went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai.
**4** to the place of the altar that he had made there at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
**5** And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.
**6** And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were great, and they were not able to dwell together.
**7** And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land.
**8** And Abram said to Lot, “Let there, I pray you, be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.”
**9** Is not the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; and if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.
**10** And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
**11** And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward, and they separated, each man from his brother.
**12** Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent as far as Sodom.
**13** Now the men of Sodom were wicked and great sinners against the LORD.
**14** And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward.”
**15** For all the land that you see, I will give it to you and to your seed forever.
**16** And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man is able to number the dust of the earth, then your seed also will be numbered.
**17** Rise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth, for to you I will give it.
**18** And Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.

## Chapter 14

**1** And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,
**2** made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
**3** All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim; it is the Salt Sea.
**4** Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
**5** And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim.
**6** and the Horite in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
**7** And they returned and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekite, and also the Amorite who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
**8** And the king of Sodom went out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is Zoar), and they arrayed battle with them in the Valley of Siddim.
**9** Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
**10** Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there, and those who remained fled to the hill country.
**11** And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
**12** And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, and his possessions, and departed, for he was dwelling in Sodom.
**13** Then the one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was dwelling by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.
**14** And Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, and he mustered his trained men, those born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
**15** And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus.
**16** And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back Lot his kinsman and his goods, and likewise the women and the people.
**17** And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from striking Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
**18** And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; and he was priest of God Most High.
**19** And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth.”
**20** And blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
**21** And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the goods for yourself.”
**22** And Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
**23** that I will not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you say, “I have made Abram rich.”
**24** Except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—let them take their portion.

## Chapter 15

**1** After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not fear, Abram; I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.”
**2** And Abram said, “Lord GOD, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
**3** And Abram said, “Behold, to me you have not given seed, and behold, a son of my house is the one who will inherit me.”
**4** And behold, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “This man shall not be your heir, but he who comes forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.”
**5** And He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” And he said to him, “So shall your seed be.”
**6** And he believed in the LORD, and the LORD counted it to him as righteousness.
**7** And He said to me, “I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.”
**8** And he said, “Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?”
**9** And He said to me, “Take for me a heifer three years old, and a female goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
**10** And he took for himself all these, and cut them in two in the midst, and set each piece opposite its fellow; but the bird he did not cut.
**11** And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
**12** And it came to pass, as the sun was going down, that a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, dread and great darkness fell upon him.
**13** And He said to Abram, “Know for certain that your seed will be a sojourner in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.”
**14** And also the nation whom they serve I will judge, and after that they shall come out with great possessions.
**15** But you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
**16** And in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.
**17** And it came to pass, when the sun had gone down and it was dark, that behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
**18** On that day the LORD cut a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.”
**19** the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
**20** the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim
**21** and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.

## Chapter 16

**1** Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children; and she had an Egyptian maidservant, and her name was Hagar.
**2** And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray you, to my maidservant; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
**3** And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her maidservant, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
**4** And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
**5** And Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong be upon you. I myself gave my maidservant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May the LORD judge between me and you.”
**6** And Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maidservant is in your hand; do to her what is good in your eyes.” And Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her presence.
**7** And the Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.
**8** And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, from where have you come, and where are you going?” And she said, “From the presence of Sarai my mistress I am fleeing.”
**9** And the angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.”
**10** And the angel of the LORD said to her, “I will surely multiply your seed, so that it shall not be numbered for multitude.”
**11** And the angel of the LORD said to her, “Behold, you are with child and will bear a son, and you shall call His name Ishmael, because the LORD has heard your affliction.”
**12** And he will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; and he will dwell in the face of all his brothers.
**13** And she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said, “Have I even here seen after Him who sees me?”
**14** Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
**15** And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
**16** And Abram was eighty years old and six years when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Chapter 17

**1** When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to Him, “I am God Almighty; walk before Me and be blameless.”
**2** And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.
**3** And Abram fell upon his face, and God spoke with him, saying,
**4** As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
**5** And your name shall no more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
**6** And I will make you exceedingly, exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come forth from you.
**7** And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your seed after you.
**8** And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be God to them.
**9** And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.”
**10** This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.
**11** And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
**12** And at eight days old every male among you shall be circumcised throughout your generations, he who is born in the house and he who is bought with silver from any son of a foreigner who is not of your seed.
**13** He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must surely be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
**14** And an uncircumcised male who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.
**15** And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.”
**16** And I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her; and I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.
**17** Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?”
**18** And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you.”
**19** And God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call His name Isaac. And I will establish My covenant with Him as an everlasting covenant for His seed after Him.”
**20** And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly, exceedingly. Twelve princes he shall beget, and I will make him a great nation.
**21** But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time in the next year.
**22** When He finished speaking with him, God went up from Abraham.
**23** And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had spoken with him.
**24** And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
**25** And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
**26** On that very day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
**27** And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with silver from the son of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

## Chapter 18

**1** And the LORD appeared to me by the oaks of Mamre, as He was sitting at the entrance of the tent in the heat of the day.
**2** And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing over against him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the ground.
**3** and he said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.”
**4** Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
**5** And I will take a piece of bread, and you shall refresh your heart; after that you may pass on, since for this reason you have passed by your servant. And they said, “So do, as you have spoken.”
**6** And Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Hurry, take three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes.”
**7** And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a tender and good calf, and gave it to the young man, and he hurried to prepare it.
**8** And he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
**9** And they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “Behold, in the tent.”
**10** And he said, “I will surely return to you at this time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.
**11** Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in days; the way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
**12** So Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I am worn out, shall I have pleasure, and my lord is old?”
**13** And the LORD said to Abraham, “Why is it that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’”
**14** Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
**15** Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid. But he said, “No, but you did laugh.”
**16** Then the men rose up from there and looked out toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on their way.
**17** And the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?”
**18** seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
**19** For I have known him, that he may command his sons and his household after him, that they keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken concerning him.
**20** And the LORD said, “Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is very grievous,”
**21** I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to its outcry that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.
**22** And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD.
**23** And Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?”
**24** Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city; will you indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
**25** Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked. Far be it from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do justice?
**26** And the LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
**27** And Abraham answered and said, “Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, though I am but dust and ashes.”
**28** Perhaps the fifty righteous will lack five. Will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And He said, “I will not destroy it if I find there forty-five.”
**29** And he added still to speak to him and said, “Perhaps forty will be found there.” And he said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty.”
**30** And he said, “Oh, let not my Lord be angry, and let me speak: perhaps thirty will be found there.” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
**31** And he said, “Behold now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to my Lord; perhaps twenty will be found there.” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.”
**32** And he said, “Oh, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak but this once more. Perhaps ten will be found there.” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.”
**33** And the LORD went away, when He had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

## Chapter 19

**1** And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them and rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground.
**2** And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into the house of your servant, and lodge, and wash your feet; and in the morning you shall rise early and go on your way. And they said, No; but in the street we will lodge.
**3** And he pressed them greatly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
**4** Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from young to old, all the people to the last.
**5** And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.”
**6** And Lot went out to them at the entrance, and he shut the door after him.
**7** And he said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.”
**8** Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do to them as is good in your eyes. Only to these men do not do anything, for therefore they have come under the shadow of my roof.
**9** And they said, “Stand back.” And they said, “This one came in to sojourn, and he is indeed acting as a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” And they pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near to break the door.
**10** But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot in to them into the house, and they shut the door.
**11** And the men who were at the entrance of the house they struck with blindness, from the least to the greatest, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the entrance.
**12** Then the men said to Lot, “Who else do you have here? A son-in-law, and your sons and your daughters, and whoever you have in the city—bring them out of this place.”
**13** For we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has grown great before the face of the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.
**14** And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were taking his daughters, and said, “Rise, go out from this place, for the LORD is destroying the city.” But in the eyes of his sons-in-law he was as one who mocked.
**15** And when the dawn had risen, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Rise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city.”
**16** But he lingered; so the men seized him by his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hand of his two daughters, the compassion of the LORD being upon him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
**17** And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth outside, that he said, “Escape for your life; do not look behind you, and do not stand still in all the plain. Escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.”
**18** But Lot said to them, “Oh no, my lords.”
**19** Behold now, your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have magnified your mercy which you have shown to me in preserving my life; but I am not able to escape to the hill, lest the evil overtake me and I die.
**20** Behold now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there, I pray; is it not a little one? And my soul shall live.
**21** And he said to him, “Behold, I have shown you favor also in this matter, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.”
**22** Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
**23** The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
**24** Then the LORD rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
**25** And He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
**26** But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
**27** And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the face of the LORD.
**28** And he looked toward the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the face of the land of the plain, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
**29** And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.
**30** And Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hill country, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to live in Zoar; and he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters.
**31** And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.”
**32** Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed from our father.
**33** So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
**34** And it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine also tonight, and you go in, lie with him, that we may preserve seed from our father.”
**35** And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
**36** Thus the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.
**37** And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of Moab to this day.
**38** And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

## Chapter 20

**1** And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
**2** And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
**3** But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is another man’s wife.”
**4** Now Abimelech had not come near her, and he said, “Lord, will You also slay a righteous nation?”
**5** Did he not himself say to me, “She is my sister”? And she, even she herself, said, “He is my brother.” In the integrity of my heart and in the innocence of my hands I have done this.
**6** And God said to Him in the dream, “I also knew that you did this in the integrity of your heart, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.”
**7** Now therefore, restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you and all that are yours.
**8** And Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and spoke all these words in their hearing, and the men were very afraid.
**9** And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Deeds that ought not to be done you have done to me.”
**10** And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
**11** Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’”
**12** And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
**13** And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, “This is your kindness which you shall show to me: in every place to which we come, say of me, ‘He is my brother.’”
**14** And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.
**15** And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell wherever it is good in your eyes.”
**16** And to Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all who are with you, and with all you are vindicated.”
**17** And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, and they bore children.
**18** For the LORD had completely closed up every womb in the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.

## Chapter 21

**1** And the LORD visited Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had spoken.
**2** And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.
**3** And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
**4** And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
**5** And Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
**6** And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”
**7** And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham, ‘Sarah will nurse sons’? For I have borne a son in his old age.”
**8** And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
**9** And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
**10** And she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac.”
**11** And the matter was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
**12** And God said to Abraham, “Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your maidservant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your Seed be called.”
**13** And also the son of the slave woman I will make into a nation, because he is your seed.
**14** And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the boy, and sent her away; and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
**15** And the water in the skin was spent, and she cast the boy under one of the shrubs.
**16** And she went and sat down by herself opposite, a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Let me not see the death of the child.” And she sat opposite, and lifted up her voice and wept.
**17** And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where He is.”
**18** Rise, lift up the boy, and hold fast your hand upon him, for I will make him a great nation.
**19** And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy drink.
**20** And God was with the boy, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness and became an archer.
**21** And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt.
**22** And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phicol the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.”
**23** So now swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, or with my offspring, or with my posterity, but as the kindness that I have done with you, you shall do with me and with the land in which you have sojourned.
**24** And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
**25** But Abraham reproved Abimelech concerning the matter of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.
**26** And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you also have not told me, and I myself have not heard of it until today.”
**27** And Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them cut a covenant.
**28** And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
**29** And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What are these seven ewe lambs here, which you have set by themselves?”
**30** He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well.”
**31** Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath.
**32** So they cut a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.
**33** And he planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
**34** And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

## Chapter 22

**1** And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham.” And he said, “Here I am.”
**2** And he said, “Take now your son, your only one, whom you love, Isaac, and go for yourself to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will tell you of.”
**3** And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had spoken to him.
**4** On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
**5** And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go over there and worship and return to you.”
**6** And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife, and the two of them went on together.
**7** And Isaac said to Abraham his father, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
**8** And Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them went on together.
**9** And they came to the place that God had told him of, and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
**10** And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
**11** And the Angel of the LORD called to Him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham.” And He said, “Here I am.”
**12** And he said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the boy, and do not do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.”
**13** And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
**14** And Abraham called the name of that place “The LORD Will Provide,” as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it will be provided.”
**15** And the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
**16** And he said, “By myself I have sworn,” declares the LORD, “because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,”
**17** indeed blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand that is on the seashore, and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.
**18** And in your Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.
**19** And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
**20** And it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah also has borne sons to Nahor your brother.”
**21** Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.
**22** and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.
**23** And Bethuel fathered Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
**24** And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.

## Chapter 23

**1** And the years of Sarah’s life were one hundred years and twenty years and seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
**2** And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
**3** Then Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
**4** I am a sojourner and a foreigner among you; give me a possession of a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
**5** And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
**6** Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God among us; in the choicest of our tombs bury your dead. None of us will withhold his tomb from you, to prevent you from burying your dead.
**7** Then Abraham rose and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth.
**8** and he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your desire to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar,
**9** that he may give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him, which is at the end of his field. For full silver let him give it to me in your midst as a possession for a burial place.
**10** Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth, of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
**11** No, my lord, listen to me: the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; in the sight of the sons of my people I have given it to you. Bury your dead.
**12** And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
**13** And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “Only if you would hear me: I have given the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”
**14** And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
**15** My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.
**16** And Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had spoken of in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.
**17** So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave that was in it, and every tree that was in the field, that was within all its border all around, was established
**18** to Abraham as a purchased possession, in the sight of the sons of Heth, among all who entered the gate of his city.
**19** And after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
**20** So the field, and the cave that is in it, were made over to Abraham for a possession of a burial place from the sons of Heth.

## Chapter 24

**1** Now Abraham was old, advanced in days, and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
**2** And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh.”
**3** and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite among whom I dwell.
**4** but you shall go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
**5** And the servant said to me, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to go after me to this land. Must I then bring your son back to the land from which you came?”
**6** And Abraham said to me, “Guard yourself, that you do not return my son there.”
**7** The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, “To your seed I will give this land,” he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
**8** But if the woman is not willing to go after you, then you will be released from this my oath; only do not bring my son back there.
**9** So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
**10** And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and went, and all the good things of his master were in his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
**11** And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, at the time when women go out to draw water.
**12** And he said, “O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please cause it to happen before me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.”
**13** Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
**14** And let it be that the young woman to whom I shall say, “Please lower your jar that I may drink,” and who shall say, “Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,” let her be the one you have appointed for your servant, for Isaac; and by this I shall know that you have shown kindness to my master.
**15** And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her jar upon her shoulder.
**16** Now the young woman was very beautiful in appearance, a virgin, and no man had known her. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
**17** And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”
**18** And she said, “Drink, my lord,” and she hurried and lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
**19** When she had finished giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels until they have finished drinking.”
**20** And she hurried and emptied her jar into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
**21** And the man gazed at her in silence, to know whether the LORD had made his way prosper or not.
**22** And it came to pass, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a gold nose-ring of half a shekel in weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten shekels of gold in weight.
**23** And he said, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please. Is there in your father’s house a place for us to lodge?”
**24** And she said to me, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”
**25** And she said to me, “We have both straw and much fodder with us, and also a place to lodge.”
**26** And the man bowed his head and prostrated himself before the LORD.
**27** Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His charity and His faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master’s brothers.
**28** And the young woman ran and told her mother’s household according to these words.
**29** Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.
**30** And it came to pass, when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he came to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
**31** And he said, “Come in, blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside, when I have cleared the house and a place for the camels?”
**32** So the man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels, and gave straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
**33** And food was set before me to eat, but I said, “I will not eat until I have spoken my words.” And he said, “Speak.”
**34** And he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.”
**35** And the LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
**36** And Sarah, my master’s wife, has borne a son to my master after her old age, and he has given to him all that he has.
**37** And my master made me swear, saying, “You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanite in whose land I dwell.”
**38** but you shall go to my father's house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.
**39** And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’
**40** And he said to me, “The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and prosper your way, and you shall take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house.”
**41** Then you will be released from my oath, when you come to my family; and if they do not give her to you, you will be released from my oath.
**42** And I came this day to the spring and said, “Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if now you are indeed prospering my way which I am going,
**43** Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and it shall be that the young woman who comes out to draw, and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”
**44** and she says to me, “You drink, and I will also draw for your camels,” let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.
**45** Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, “Please let me drink.”
**46** And she hurried and lowered her jar from upon her, and said, “Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.” So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.
**47** And I asked her and said, “Whose daughter are you?” And she said, “The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.” Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
**48** And I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the true way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.
**49** And now, if you will deal in kindness and in truth with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
**50** Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The matter has come out from the LORD; we are not able to speak to you bad or good.”
**51** Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be a wife to your master’s son, as the LORD has spoken.
**52** And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD.
**53** And the servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold and garments, and he gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
**54** And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and they spent the night there. And they rose in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”
**55** And her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us days, or ten; after that she shall go.”
**56** And he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way; send me away, that I may go to my master.”
**57** And they said, “Let us call the young woman and inquire of her mouth.”
**58** And they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”
**59** So they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
**60** And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands, and may your Seed possess the gate of those who hate him.”
**61** Then Rebekah arose, and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went after the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went.
**62** Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi, and he was dwelling in the land of the Negev.
**63** And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening, and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming.
**64** And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she dismounted from the camel.
**65** And she said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “It is my master.” So she took the veil and covered herself.
**66** And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
**67** And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother.

## Chapter 25

**1** And Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
**2** And she bore to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
**3** And Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, and the Letushim, and the Leummim.
**4** And the sons of Midian were Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
**5** And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
**6** But to the sons of Abraham’s concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the land of the east.
**7** And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
**8** And Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of days, and was gathered to his people.
**9** Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
**10** the field that Abraham bought from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.
**11** And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac His son, and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
**12** Now these are the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.
**13** And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam.
**14** and Mishma and Dumah and Massa.
**15** Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
**16** These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their settlements and by their encampments: twelve princes according to their nations.
**17** And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
**18** And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt as you go toward Assyria; he fell in opposition to all his brothers.
**19** Now these are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham fathered Isaac.
**20** And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to himself for a wife.
**21** And Isaac pleaded with the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD was pleaded with by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
**22** And the sons struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is so, why then am I?” And she went to inquire of the LORD.
**23** And the LORD said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided; and one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger.”
**24** And her days to give birth were fulfilled, and behold, twins were in her womb.
**25** And the first came out red, all of him like a hairy cloak; and they called his name Esau.
**26** And afterward his brother came out, and his hand was grasping Esau’s heel; so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
**27** And the boys grew, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents.
**28** And Isaac loved Esau, because game was in his mouth, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
**29** And Jacob cooked stew, and Esau came in from the field, and he was weary.
**30** And Esau said to Jacob, “Please let me gulp down some of this red, this red stew, for I am weary.” Therefore his name was called Edom.
**31** And Jacob said, “Sell me this day your birthright.”
**32** Esau said, “Behold, I am going to die; and of what use to me is a birthright?”
**33** And Jacob said, “Swear to me this day.” And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.
**34** And Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised the birthright.

## Chapter 26

**1** And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that had been in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
**2** And the LORD appeared to Him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land that I shall tell you of.”
**3** Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you and to your Seed I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
**4** And I will multiply your Seed as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to your Seed all these lands, and in your Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
**5** because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws
**6** So Isaac settled in Gerar.
**7** And the men of the place asked about his wife, and he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife,” lest the men of the place kill him because of Rebekah, for she was of fair appearance.
**8** And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through the window, and he saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah his wife.
**9** And Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Surely, look, she is your wife. How then did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”
**10** And Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
**11** And Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
**12** And Isaac sowed in that land, and in that same year he found a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him.
**13** And the man became great, and went on, going and becoming greater, until he became very great.
**14** And he had flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a great many servants, and the Philistines envied him.
**15** And all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them and filled them with dust.
**16** And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you have become much mightier than we.”
**17** And Isaac went from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
**18** And Isaac returned and dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
**19** And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water.
**20** And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
**21** And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it also; and he called its name Sitnah.
**22** And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called its name Rehoboth, and he said, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”
**23** And he went up from there to Beersheba.
**24** And the LORD appeared to Him that night and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not fear, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed for the sake of Abraham My servant.”
**25** And he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there, and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.
**26** And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the commander of his army.
**27** And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?”
**28** And they said, We have surely seen that the LORD has been with you; so we said, Let there now be an oath between us, between us and you, and let us cut a covenant with you.
**29** that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you, and just as we have done only good with you and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.
**30** And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
**31** And they rose early in the morning and swore each man to his brother; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
**32** And it came to pass on that day that the servants of Isaac came and told him about the matter of the well which they had dug, and they said to him, “We have found water.”
**33** And he called it Shebah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
**34** When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
**35** And they were a bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.

## Chapter 27

**1** And it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”
**2** And he said, “Behold now, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.”
**3** Now therefore, take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.
**4** and make for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die.
**5** Now Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt game to bring it.
**6** And Rebekah said to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother, saying,”
**7** Bring me game and make me savory food, that I may eat, and I will bless you before the LORD before my death.
**8** Now therefore, my son, obey my voice in what I command you.
**9** Go now to the flock, and take for me from there two good young goats, and I will make them into savory food for your father, such as he loves.
**10** and you shall bring it to your father, and he shall eat, so that he may bless you before his death.
**11** And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.”
**12** Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall be in his eyes as a deceiver; and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.
**13** And his mother said to him, “Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, take them for me.”
**14** And he went and took and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
**15** And Rebekah took the choice garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
**16** And the skins of the young goats she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck.
**17** And she put the savory food and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob her son.
**18** And he came to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”
**19** Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you spoke to me. Rise, please, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.”
**20** And Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God caused it to happen before me.”
**21** And Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near, I pray, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are indeed my son Esau or not.”
**22** So Jacob drew near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
**23** And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother; so he blessed him.
**24** And he said, “Are you indeed my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.”
**25** And he said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, that my soul may bless you.” And he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
**26** And his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.”
**27** And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.”
**28** May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and new wine.
**29** Let peoples serve you, and let nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and let the sons of your mother bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you.
**30** And it came to pass, as Isaac finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
**31** And he also made savory food and brought it to his father, and he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.”
**32** And Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”
**33** And Isaac trembled with a very great trembling, and said, “Who then is he that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate of all before you came, and I blessed him? Indeed, he shall be blessed.”
**34** When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and he said to his father, “Bless me, me also, my father.”
**35** And he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken your blessing.”
**36** And he said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing.” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”
**37** And Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him as servants, and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. And for you then, what can I do, my son?”
**38** And Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
**39** Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, “Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven above.”
**40** And by your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall be, when you grow restless, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.
**41** So Esau bore hatred against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill Jacob my brother.”
**42** And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, and she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself about you, planning to kill you.”
**43** And now, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee for yourself to Laban my brother, to Haran.
**44** and you shall stay with him some days, until your brother’s fury turns away.
**45** until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
**46** And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these, from the daughters of the land, what is life to me?”

## Chapter 28

**1** And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him and said to him, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.”
**2** Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father, and take for yourself from there a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
**3** And God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and you shall become a company of peoples.
**4** And may he give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your Seed with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.
**5** And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
**6** And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take for himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he commanded him, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.”
**7** And Jacob listened to his father and to his mother, and went to Paddan-aram.
**8** And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father.
**9** And Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, the sister of Nebaioth, in addition to his wives, to himself for a wife.
**10** And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
**11** And he came upon a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set. And he took from the stones of that place and put them at his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
**12** And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
**13** And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your seed.”
**14** And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall burst forth to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you shall all the families of the ground be blessed, and in your Seed.
**15** Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.
**16** And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.”
**17** And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
**18** And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on its top.
**19** And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
**20** And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I am going, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,”
**21** and I return in peace to my father’s house, then the LORD shall be God to me.
**22** And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that you give me I will surely tithe it to you.

## Chapter 29

**1** Then Jacob lifted up his feet and went to the land of the sons of the east.
**2** And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and behold, there three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks, and the stone upon the mouth of the well was great.
**3** And there all the flocks would be gathered, and they would roll the stone from upon the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back upon the mouth of the well in its place.
**4** And Jacob said to them, “My brothers, from where are you?” And they said, “We are from Haran.”
**5** And he said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”
**6** And he said to them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “It is well; and behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.”
**7** He said, “Behold, the day is still great; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the flock, and go, pasture them.”
**8** And they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”
**9** While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock that belonged to her father, for she was a shepherdess.
**10** And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the flock of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob drew near and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
**11** And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.
**12** And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.
**13** And it came to pass, when Laban heard the report of Jacob, his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him into his house. And he recounted to Laban all these things.
**14** And Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him a month of days.
**15** Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my brother, should you serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”
**16** Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
**17** Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.
**18** And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”
**19** And Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”
**20** And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were in his eyes but a few days, because of his love for her.
**21** And Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”
**22** So Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.
**23** And it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her.
**24** And Laban gave to her Zilpah his maidservant, to Leah his daughter, as a maidservant.
**25** And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?”
**26** And Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.”
**27** Fulfill this week, and we will also give you this one for the service that you will serve with me yet another seven years.
**28** And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to him as a wife.
**29** And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maidservant, to be a maidservant to her.
**30** And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved Rachel also more than Leah, and he served with him yet seven other years.
**31** And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
**32** And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, “Because the LORD has seen my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”
**33** And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, He has also given me this one,” and she called his name Simeon.
**34** And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.
**35** And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she called his name Judah; then she ceased bearing.

## Chapter 30

**1** And Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, and Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, “Give me sons, and if not, I am dead.”
**2** And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
**3** She said, “Behold my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also shall be built up through her.”
**4** And she gave him Bilhah her maidservant as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
**5** And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
**6** And Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan.
**7** And Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
**8** And Rachel said, “With wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, and I have also prevailed.” So she called his name Naphtali.
**9** When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
**10** And Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, bore Jacob a son.
**11** And Leah said, “Fortune has come!” So she called his name Gad.
**12** And Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, bore a second son to Jacob.
**13** And Leah said, “How happy am I, for daughters will call me blessed.” So she called his name Asher.
**14** And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, “Give me, I pray you, some of your son’s mandrakes.”
**15** And she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband, that you would also take the mandrakes of my son?” And Rachel said, “Therefore he shall lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”
**16** And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.
**17** And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
**18** And Leah said, “God has given my wages, because I gave my maidservant to my husband.” And she called his name Issachar.
**19** And Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
**20** And Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she called his name Zebulun.
**21** Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
**22** And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.
**23** And she conceived and bore a son, and she said, “God has taken away my reproach.”
**24** And she called his name Joseph, saying, “May the LORD add to me another son.”
**25** And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country.”
**26** Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.
**27** And Laban said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, I have divined that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”
**28** And he said, “Name your wages for me, and I will give it.”
**29** And he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has been with me.”
**30** For it was little that you had before I came, and it has broken forth to abundance, and the LORD has blessed you at my footstep; but now, when shall I also provide for my own house?
**31** And he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it.”
**32** I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep, and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and that shall be my wages.
**33** And my righteousness will answer for me tomorrow, when you come concerning my wages that are before you: every one among the goats that is not speckled and spotted, and brown among the lambs, will be counted stolen with me.
**34** And Laban said, “Behold, would that it be according to your word.”
**35** And he removed that day the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the dark ones among the lambs, and he put them into the hand of his sons.
**36** And he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban’s flock.
**37** And Jacob took for himself fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane tree, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was on the rods.
**38** And he set the rods which he had peeled in the troughs, in the watering channels, where the flocks came to drink, in front of the flocks; and they were in heat when they came to drink.
**39** And the flock grew hot before the rods, and the flock bore young that were striped, speckled, and spotted.
**40** And Jacob separated the lambs, and he set the faces of the flock toward the striped and all the dark ones in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock.
**41** And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock were in heat, that Jacob set the rods before the eyes of the flock in the troughs, that they might conceive among the rods.
**42** But when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in; so the feeble were Laban’s, and the strong were Jacob’s.
**43** And the man increased exceedingly, exceedingly, and he had many flocks, and female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

## Chapter 31

**1** And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has made all this wealth.”
**2** And Jacob saw the face of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before, yesterday and the day before.
**3** And the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”
**4** And Jacob sent and called for Rachel and for Leah to the field, to his flock.
**5** He said to them, “I see your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.”
**6** And you yourselves know that with all my strength I have served your father.
**7** And your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to do evil with me.
**8** If he said thus, “The speckled shall be your wages,” then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said thus, “The striped shall be your wages,” then all the flock bore striped.
**9** So God has delivered the livestock of your father and has given them to me.
**10** And it came to pass at the time when the flock was in heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, speckled, and mottled.
**11** And the angel of God said to me in the dream, “Jacob,” and I said, “Here I am.”
**12** And he said, “Now lift up your eyes and see: all the he-goats that go up upon the flock are striped, speckled, and spotted, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.”
**13** I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, go out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.
**14** And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there still for us any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?”
**15** Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has indeed consumed our silver.
**16** For all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our sons; and now, whatever God has said to you, do.
**17** Then Jacob arose and lifted up his sons and his wives upon the camels.
**18** And he drove away all his livestock and all his goods that he had acquired, the livestock of his possession that he had gained in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
**19** Now Laban had gone to shear his flock, and Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father.
**20** And Jacob stole away the heart of Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he was fleeing.
**21** So he fled, he and all that belonged to him; and he arose and crossed the river, and he set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
**22** And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
**23** And he took his brothers with him and pursued after him a way of seven days, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
**24** And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, “Take heed to yourself that you do not speak with Jacob either good or evil.”
**25** And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban had pitched with his brothers in the hill country of Gilead.
**26** And Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have stolen my heart and driven my daughters away like captives of the sword?”
**27** Why did you hide yourself to flee, and steal away from me, and not tell me, that I might send you away with gladness and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre?
**28** and you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters; now you have acted foolishly.
**29** It is in the power of my hand to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, “Take heed to yourself that you do not speak with Jacob either good or evil.”
**30** And now you have surely gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house; but why have you stolen my gods?
**31** And Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you take your daughters from me by force.’”
**32** With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our brothers discern for yourself what is with me, and take it for yourself. Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
**33** And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.
**34** Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about in all the tent, but did not find them.
**35** And she said to her father, “Let it not be displeasing in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me.” So he searched, but did not find the household idols.
**36** And Jacob burned with anger and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?”
**37** For you have felt about through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, and let them judge between us two.
**38** These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats did not miscarry, and the rams of your flock I did not eat.
**39** That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
**40** By day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
**41** These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
**42** If not for the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, being for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.
**43** And Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that you see is mine. But for my daughters, what can I do for these today, or for their sons whom they have borne?”
**44** So now come, let us cut a covenant, I and you, and let it be for a witness between me and you.
**45** And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
**46** And Jacob said to his brothers, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there upon the heap.
**47** And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
**48** And Laban said, “This heap is a witness between me and you today.” Therefore he called its name Galeed.
**49** and Mizpah, for he said, “May the LORD watch between me and you, when we are hidden one from another.
**50** If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, though no man is with us, see, God is witness between me and you.
**51** And Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set between me and you.
**52** This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
**53** The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
**54** And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his brothers to eat bread; and they ate bread and lodged on the mountain.

## Chapter 32

**1** And Laban rose early in the morning and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; then Laban departed and returned to his place.
**2** And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
**3** And Jacob said when he saw them, “This is the camp of God,” and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
**4** And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
**5** And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.’”
**6** And I have ox and donkey, flock and male servant and female servant, and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.
**7** And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother, to Esau, and moreover he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”
**8** Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed, and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two camps.
**9** And he said, “If Esau comes to the one camp and strikes it, then the camp that is left will escape.”
**10** And Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your kindred, and I will do good to you,’”
**11** I am unworthy of all the mercies and of all the truth that you have shown to your servant, for with my staff I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
**12** Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest he come and strike me, mother with children.
**13** And you said, “I will surely do good to you, and I will make your seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.”
**14** And he lodged there that night, and took from what had come into his hand a gift for Esau his brother.
**15** two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams
**16** thirty milking camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys
**17** And he put them into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”
**18** And he commanded the first, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and whose are these before you?’”
**19** and you shall say, “They are your servant Jacob’s; it is a gift sent to my lord Esau, and behold, he also is behind us.”
**20** And he commanded also the second, and also the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, “According to this word you shall speak to Esau when you find him.”
**21** And you shall say moreover, “Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us.” For he said, “I will appease his face with the gift that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will lift up my face.”
**22** So the present went over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
**23** And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two maidservants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.
**24** And he took them and sent them over the stream, and he sent over all that he had.
**25** And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn.
**26** And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the socket of his hip; and Jacob’s hip socket was dislocated as he wrestled with him.
**27** And he said, “Let me go, for the dawn has risen.” But he said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
**28** And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
**29** And he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have contended with God and with men, and have prevailed.”
**30** And Jacob asked and said, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask for my name?” And he blessed him there.
**31** And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen God face to face, and my life has been delivered.
**32** And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he was limping upon his thigh.
**33** Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip that is upon the socket of the thigh to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.

## Chapter 33

**1** And Jacob lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. So he divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants.
**2** And he put the maidservants and their children in front, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.
**3** And he himself passed on before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he drew near to his brother.
**4** And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
**5** And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children, and he said, “Who are these with you?” And he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
**6** Then the maidservants drew near, they and their children, and they bowed down.
**7** Then Leah also approached with her children, and they bowed themselves; and afterward Joseph and Rachel approached, and they bowed themselves.
**8** And he said, “Who is to you all this camp which I met?” And he said, “To find favor in the eyes of my lord.”
**9** But Esau said, “I have much, my brother; let what is yours be yours.”
**10** And Jacob said, “Please, if now I have found favor in your eyes, then receive my gift from my hand, for therefore I have seen your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me.”
**11** Please take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have all. And he urged him, and he took it.
**12** Let us set out and go, and I will go before you.
**13** But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the flocks and herds nursing their young are with me; and if they drive them hard for one day, all the flock will die.”
**14** Let my lord, I pray, pass on before his servant, and I will lead on gently, at the pace of the livestock that are before me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.
**15** Then Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Why this? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
**16** So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
**17** But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.
**18** And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
**19** And he bought the parcel of the field where he had pitched his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
**20** And he set up there an altar and called it El, the God of Israel.

## Chapter 34

**1** And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
**2** And Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the land, saw her; and he took her and lay with her and violated her.
**3** And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke to the heart of the young woman.
**4** And Shechem spoke to Hamor his father, saying, “Get me this girl for a wife.”
**5** And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field, and Jacob kept silent until they came.
**6** And Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to Jacob to speak with him.
**7** And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it, and the men were grieved and burned with great anger, because he had done a vile thing in Israel by lying with the daughter of Jacob, and such a thing must not be done.
**8** And Hamor spoke with them, saying, “Shechem my son’s soul longs for your daughter; please give her to him as a wife.”
**9** And make marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
**10** Dwell with us, and the land shall be before you; settle and trade in it, and take possession in it.
**11** And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.”
**12** Make the bride-price and gift upon me exceedingly great; and I will give according to what you say to me. Only give me the young woman as a wife.
**13** And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.
**14** And they said to them, “We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, for that is a reproach to us.”
**15** Only on this condition will we agree with you: if you become as we are, by every male among you being circumcised.
**16** then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people
**17** But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and we will go.
**18** And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem son of Hamor.
**19** And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter; and he was honored above all the house of his father.
**20** And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
**21** These men are peaceable with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is wide on every side before them. We will take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and we will give our daughters to them.
**22** Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
**23** Will not their livestock and their possessions and all their beasts be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
**24** And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
**25** And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, brothers of Dinah, each took his sword, and came upon the city securely, and killed every male.
**26** And Hamor and Shechem his son they killed with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went out.
**27** The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
**28** Their flock, and their herd, and their donkeys, and what was in the city and what was in the field, they took.
**29** And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive and plundered, and all that was in the house.
**30** And Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me, making me stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite and the Perizzite; and I am few in number, and they will gather themselves against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”
**31** And they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”

## Chapter 35

**1** And God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”
**2** Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.”
**3** And let us arise and go up to Bethel, and there I will make an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.
**4** And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their hands, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth that was near Shechem.
**5** And they set out, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were around them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
**6** And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Bethel), he and all the people who were with him.
**7** And he built an altar there and called the place El-bethel, because there the God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from the face of his brother.
**8** And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; therefore he called its name Allon-bacuth.
**9** And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.
**10** And God said to Him, “Your name is Jacob; your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” And He called His name Israel.
**11** And God said to Him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.”
**12** And the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you I will give the land.
**13** And God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
**14** And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
**15** And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
**16** And they journeyed from Bethel, and when there was still some distance of the land to come to Ephrath, Rachel gave birth, and she had hard labor in her bearing.
**17** And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor in her bearing, that the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you also have this son.”
**18** And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she was dying), that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
**19** And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
**20** And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.
**21** And Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-eder.
**22** And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
**23** The sons of Leah: Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
**24** The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
**25** And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant: Dan and Naphtali.
**26** And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
**27** And Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
**28** And the days of Isaac were one hundred years and eighty years.
**29** And Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

## Chapter 36

**1** Now these are the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
**2** Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite.
**3** and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
**4** And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz, and Basemath bore Reuel.
**5** And Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah; these are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
**6** And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his household, and his livestock, and all his cattle, and all his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from the presence of Jacob his brother.
**7** For their possessions were too many for them to dwell together, and the land of their sojourning could not sustain them because of their livestock.
**8** So Esau dwelt in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
**9** And these are the generations of Esau, the father of Edom, in the hill country of Seir.
**10** These are the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
**11** And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
**12** And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz the son of Esau, and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.
**13** And these were the sons of Reuel: Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
**14** And these were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.
**15** These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau—chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz.
**16** chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek; these are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
**17** And these are the sons of Reuel the son of Esau: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
**18** And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.
**19** These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs; he is Edom.
**20** These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah.
**21** and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan; these are the chiefs of the Horite, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
**22** And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and the sister of Lotan was Timna.
**23** And these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
**24** And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is that Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father.
**25** And these are the sons of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.
**26** And these are the sons of Dishan: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
**27** These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
**28** These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
**29** These are the chiefs of the Horite: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah.
**30** chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan; these are the chiefs of the Horite, according to their chiefs, in the land of Seir.
**31** And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before a king reigned over the sons of Israel.
**32** And there reigned in Edom Bela son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
**33** And Bela died, and Jobab son of Zerah reigned in his place, from Bozrah.
**34** And Jobab died, and Husham reigned in his place, from the land of the Temanite.
**35** And Husham died, and Hadad son of Bedad reigned in his place, the one who struck Midian in the field of Moab; and the name of his city was Avith.
**36** And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.
**37** And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the River reigned in his place.
**38** And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place.
**39** And Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau, and the name of his wife was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
**40** And these are the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families, according to their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth;
**41** chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon
**42** chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar
**43** chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom according to their dwellings in the land of their possession. He is Esau, the father of Edom.

## Chapter 37

**1** And Jacob lived in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
**2** These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; and he was a youth with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives. And Joseph brought their evil report to their father.
**3** Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a robe of many colors.
**4** And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.
**5** And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him still more.
**6** And he said to them, “Hear now this dream that I have dreamed.”
**7** And behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright, and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.
**8** And his brothers said to him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed rule over us?” And they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
**9** And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
**10** And he told it to his father and to his brothers, and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to the ground before you?”
**11** And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
**12** And his brothers went to pasture the flock of their father in Shechem.
**13** And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”
**14** And he said to him, “Go now, see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock, and bring me back word.” So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
**15** And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, “What do you seek?”
**16** He said, “I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are pasturing.”
**17** And the man said, “They have departed from here, for I heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
**18** And they saw him from afar, and before he drew near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.
**19** And they said each man to his brother, “Behold, this master of dreams is coming.”
**20** Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits, and we will say, “A fierce animal has devoured him,” and we will see what will become of his dreams.
**21** But Reuben heard, and he delivered him out of their hand, and he said, “Let us not strike him mortally.”
**22** And Reuben said to them, “Do not shed blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
**23** And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him.
**24** And they took him and threw him into the pit; now the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
**25** Then they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and saw, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, and their camels were bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
**26** Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?”
**27** Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh. And his brothers listened.
**28** Then Midianite men, merchants, passed by; and they drew and lifted Joseph up out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
**29** And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his garments.
**30** And he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not; and as for me, where can I go?”
**31** And they took Joseph’s tunic and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood.
**32** And they sent the robe of many colors, and they brought it to their father and said, “This we have found; recognize now whether it is your son’s robe or not.”
**33** And he recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe. A vicious animal has devoured him; Joseph is surely torn to pieces.”
**34** And Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
**35** And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted; and he said, “For I will go down to my son, mourning, to Sheol.” And his father wept for him.
**36** And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard.

## Chapter 38

**1** And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
**2** And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanite man, whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in to her.
**3** And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
**4** And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
**5** And she yet again bore a son, and she called his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib when she bore him.
**6** And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
**7** But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
**8** Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to the wife of your brother, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up seed for your brother.”
**9** And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he wasted it on the ground, so as not to give seed to his brother.
**10** What he did was evil in the eyes of the LORD, and He put him to death also.
**11** Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up,” for he thought, “Lest he also die like his brothers.” So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
**12** And the days were many, and the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up to his shearers of the flock, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnah.
**13** And it was told to Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
**14** So she removed from herself the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in the entrance of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife.
**15** When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute, because she had covered her face.
**16** And he turned aside to her by the way and said, “Come now, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter‑in‑law. And she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
**17** And he said, “I will send a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “If you will give a pledge until you send it.”
**18** And he said, “What pledge shall I give you?” And she said, “Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
**19** Then she arose and went away, and she removed her veil from upon her and put on the garments of her widowhood.
**20** And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he did not find her.
**21** And he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the consecrated woman who was in Enaim by the road?” And they said, “There has not been a consecrated woman in this place.”
**22** And he returned to Judah and said, “I did not find her, and also the men of the place said, ‘There has not been a cult prostitute here.’”
**23** And Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we become a reproach. See, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”
**24** And it came to pass about three months later that it was told Judah, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and moreover, behold, she is with child by harlotry.” And Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”
**25** She was being brought out, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant.” And she said, “Discern, I pray you, whose are this signet, and the cords, and the staff.”
**26** And Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he did not know her again.
**27** And it came to pass, at the time she gave birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.
**28** And it came to pass, as she gave birth, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took it and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”
**29** And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So his name was called Perez.
**30** Afterward his brother came out, the one who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.

## Chapter 39

**1** Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
**2** And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
**3** And His master saw that the LORD was with Him, and that the LORD made all that He did to prosper in His hand.
**4** And Joseph found favor in his eyes and served him, and he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
**5** And it came to pass, from the time he appointed him over his house and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
**6** And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and with him he knew nothing of anything, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.
**7** And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife lifted up her eyes toward Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”
**8** But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master does not know with me what is in the house, and all that he has he has put into my hand.
**9** He is not greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?
**10** And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
**11** And it came to pass on this day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were there in the house.
**12** And she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.
**13** And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
**14** She called to the men of her household and spoke to them, saying, “See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew man to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.”
**15** And it happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, that he left his garment beside me and fled and went out of the house.
**16** And she laid his garment by her until his master came to his house.
**17** And she spoke to me according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant whom you have brought to us came in to me to mock me.”
**18** And it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.
**19** And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “After this manner your servant did to me,” that his anger burned.
**20** And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined; and he was there in the prison.
**21** But the LORD was with Joseph and extended charity to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief of the prison.
**22** And the chief of the prison put into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison, and whatever they did there, he was the one who did it.
**23** The chief of the prison saw nothing of anything in His hand, because the LORD was with Him; and whatever He did, the LORD made it prosper.

## Chapter 40

**1** And it came to pass after these things that the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their lord, the king of Egypt.
**2** And Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials, with the chief of the cupbearers and with the chief of the bakers.
**3** And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was confined.
**4** And the captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he ministered to them; and they were many days in custody.
**5** And they both dreamed a dream, each his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison house.
**6** And Joseph came in to them in the morning and saw them, and behold, they were troubled.
**7** And he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why are your faces downcast today?”
**8** And they said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it, I pray you, to me.”
**9** Then the chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.”
**10** And on the vine were three branches; and as it was budding, its blossom went up, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
**11** And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
**12** And Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.”
**13** Within yet three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former custom when you were his cupbearer.
**14** But remember me with you, when it is well with you, and deal, I pray you, kindly with me, and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
**15** For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.
**16** When the chief of the bakers saw that he had interpreted well, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.”
**17** And in the uppermost basket there were all kinds of food for Pharaoh, the work of a baker, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.
**18** And Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
**19** Within yet three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from upon you, and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from upon you.
**20** And it came to pass on the third day, Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
**21** And he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his cupbearing, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
**22** But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
**23** But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

## Chapter 41

**1** And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed; and behold, he stood by the Nile.
**2** And behold, from the Nile there came up seven cows, attractive in appearance and fat in flesh, and they grazed in the reed grass.
**3** And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ugly in appearance and thin of flesh, and they stood beside the cows on the bank of the Nile.
**4** And the cows that were ugly in appearance and thin of flesh ate up the seven cows that were fair in appearance and fat; and Pharaoh awoke.
**5** And he slept and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven ears of grain were coming up on one stalk, fat and good.
**6** And behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, were sprouting after them.
**7** And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
**8** And in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.
**9** Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my sins today.”
**10** Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief of the bakers.
**11** And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; each man dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.
**12** And there with us was a young Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told them to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; each man according to his dream he interpreted.
**13** And it came to pass, just as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
**14** Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they brought him quickly out of the pit; and he shaved and changed his garments, and came in to Pharaoh.
**15** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that you hear a dream, to interpret it.”
**16** Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me; God will answer for the welfare of Pharaoh.”
**17** And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile.
**18** And behold, from the Nile there came up seven cows, fat in flesh and beautiful in form, and they grazed in the reed-grass.
**19** And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and thin of flesh; I have never seen such as these in all the land of Egypt for badness.
**20** And the thin and evil cows devoured the seven first fat cows.
**21** And they came into their inward parts, but it was not known that they had come into their inward parts, and their appearance was evil as at the beginning; and I awoke.
**22** And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears of grain were coming up on one stalk, full and good.
**23** and behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, were sprouting after them.
**24** And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I spoke to the magicians, but there was no one who could declare it to me.
**25** And Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dream is one; what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.”
**26** The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; it is one dream.
**27** And the seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind will be seven years of famine.
**28** This is the thing that I spoke to Pharaoh: what God is doing, He has shown to Pharaoh.
**29** Behold, seven years are coming of great plenty in all the land of Egypt.
**30** And seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.
**31** And the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.
**32** And as for the doubling of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it is because the matter is established by God, and God is hastening to do it.
**33** So now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
**34** Let Pharaoh act, and appoint overseers over the land, and take a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.
**35** And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, food in the cities, and let them keep it.
**36** And that food shall be for a store for the land for the seven years of famine that will be in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not be cut off by the famine.
**37** And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
**38** And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”
**39** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is none so discerning and wise as you.”
**40** You shall be over my house, and at your mouth all my people shall be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than you.
**41** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”
**42** Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and placed a gold chain around his neck.
**43** And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they called out before him, “Bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
**44** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without you no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”
**45** And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as a wife. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
**46** Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and passed through all the land of Egypt.
**47** And the land produced in the seven years of abundance by handfuls.
**48** And he gathered all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and he put the food in the cities; the food of the field of the city that was around it he put within it.
**49** And Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much, exceedingly, until he ceased counting, for it was beyond number.
**50** And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
**51** And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.”
**52** And the name of the second he called Ephraim, “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
**53** And the seven years of abundance that had been in the land of Egypt came to an end.
**54** And the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all the lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
**55** And all the land of Egypt was famished, and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all Egypt, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.”
**56** And the famine was over all the face of the land, and Joseph opened all that was in them and sold grain to Egypt, and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
**57** And all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.

## Chapter 42

**1** Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
**2** And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy grain for us from there, that we may live and not die.”
**3** So Joseph’s brothers went down, ten of them, to buy grain from Egypt.
**4** But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers, for he said, “Lest harm befall him.”
**5** And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
**6** Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
**7** Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he made himself a stranger to them and spoke harshly with them. And he said to them, “From where have you come?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
**8** And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
**9** And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
**10** And they said to him, “No, my lord; your servants have come to buy food.”
**11** We are all sons of one man; we are honest men; your servants have never been spies.
**12** And he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
**13** And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and the one is no more.”
**14** And Joseph said to them, “It is as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You are spies.’”
**15** By this you shall be tested: as Pharaoh lives, you shall not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here.
**16** Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you shall be confined, and your words shall be tested, whether truth is with you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, surely you are spies.
**17** And he gathered them into custody for three days.
**18** Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and live, for I fear God.”
**19** If you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison house, but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
**20** And your youngest brother you shall bring to me, and your words shall be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.
**21** And they said each man to his brother, “Surely we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us and we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.”
**22** And Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy’? But you did not listen; and now, behold, his blood is required.”
**23** And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.
**24** And he turned away from them and wept; then he returned to them and spoke with them, and he took Simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.
**25** Then Joseph commanded that they fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s silver to his sack, and to give them provisions for the way; and thus he did for them.
**26** And they loaded their grain on their donkeys and went from there.
**27** And one opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, and he saw his silver, and behold, it was in the mouth of his bag.
**28** And he said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack.” And their heart failed them, and they trembled, each to his brother, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
**29** And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
**30** The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us and put us under guard as if we were spies of the land.
**31** And we said to him, “We are honest men; we have not been spies.”
**32** We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
**33** And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, “By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take the grain for the hunger of your households and go.”
**34** And bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.
**35** And it came to pass, as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, each man’s bundle of silver was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of silver, they were afraid.
**36** And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin. All these things have come upon me.”
**37** Then Reuben said to his father, “Put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you; put him into my hand, and I will restore him to you.”
**38** But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the way in which you go, you will bring down my gray hair in sorrow to Sheol.”

## Chapter 43

**1** Now the famine was severe in the land.
**2** And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Return, buy us a little food.”
**3** But Judah said to me, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”
**4** If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
**5** But if you do not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, “You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.”
**6** And Israel said, “Why have you done evil to me, by telling the man that you still had a brother?”
**7** And they said, “The man asked diligently about us and about our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ And we made known to him according to these words. Could we in any way have known that he would say, ‘Bring down your brother’?”
**8** Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.”
**9** I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the blame before you all my days.
**10** For if we had not delayed, surely by now we would have returned twice.
**11** Then Israel their father said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down a present for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.”
**12** And take double money in your hand, and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks you shall carry back in your hand; perhaps it was a mistake.
**13** Take also your brother, and arise, return to the man.
**14** And God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.
**15** So the men took this gift, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
**16** When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the one who was over his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter a slaughtering and prepare it, for the men will eat with me at noon.”
**17** And the man did as Joseph had spoken, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
**18** And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house, and they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first that we are brought in, that he may roll himself upon us and fall upon us and take us for slaves, and our donkeys.”
**19** And they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house, and they spoke with him at the entrance of the house.
**20** They said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down at the first to buy food.
**21** And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging place and opened our sacks, behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.
**22** And other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
**23** Peace be to you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. And he brought Simeon out to them.
**24** And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave water, and they washed their feet, and he gave fodder for their donkeys.
**25** And they prepared the present until Joseph came at noon, for they had heard that there they would eat bread.
**26** And Joseph came into the house, and they brought to him the present that was in their hand into the house, and they bowed themselves to him to the ground.
**27** And he asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”
**28** And they said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they bowed and prostrated themselves.
**29** And he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”
**30** And Joseph hurried, for his compassions grew warm toward his brother, and he sought a place to weep; and he went into the chamber and wept there.
**31** Then he washed his face and went out, and he restrained himself and said, “Serve the bread.”
**32** And they set a place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
**33** And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled, each to his companion.
**34** And he took portions from before him and set them before them, but Benjamin’s portion was greater than the portions of all of them, five times as much. And they drank and were drunk with him.

## Chapter 44

**1** And he commanded the one who was over his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they are able to carry, and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his sack.”
**2** And my cup, the silver cup, you shall put in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the silver of his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.
**3** The morning was light, and the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
**4** They had just gone out from the city, they had not gone far, when Joseph said to the one who was over his house, “Rise, pursue after the men; and when you overtake them, you shall say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?’”
**5** Is not this the very one from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in what you have done.
**6** He overtook them and spoke to them these words.
**7** And they said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.
**8** Look, the silver that we found in the mouth of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then could we steal from your lord’s house silver or gold?
**9** He with whom it is found among your servants shall die, and we also will be my lord’s servants.
**10** He said, “Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant, but you shall be innocent.”
**11** Then they hurried, and each man brought his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
**12** And he searched, beginning with the greatest and ending with the least; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
**13** Then they tore their garments, and each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
**14** Then Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there; and they fell before him to the ground.
**15** And Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a man such as I indeed practices divination?”
**16** And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak, and how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are servants to my lord, both we and he also in whose hand the cup was found.”
**17** And he said, Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; but you, go up in peace to your father.
**18** Then Judah approached him and said, “Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, for you are even as Pharaoh.”
**19** My lord asked his servants, saying, “Do you have a father or a brother?”
**20** And we said to my lord, “We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.”
**21** And you said to your servants, “Bring him down to me, that I may set my eye upon him.”
**22** And we said to my lord, “The boy is not able to leave his father, for if he leaves his father, he will die.”
**23** And you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you shall not again see my face.’
**24** And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.
**25** And our father said, “Return, buy us a little food.”
**26** And we said, “We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.”
**27** And your servant my father said to us, “You know that my wife bore me two sons.”
**28** and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he has been torn to pieces,” and I have not seen him until now.
**29** And if you also take this one from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my gray hair in sorrow to Sheol.
**30** And now, when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, since his life is bound up with the boy’s life,
**31** and it will be, when he sees that the boy is not with us, that he will die; and your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
**32** For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, “If I do not bring him to you, then I shall bear the sin before my father all my days.”
**33** Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the young man as a servant to my lord, and let the young man go up with his brothers.
**34** For how shall I go up to my father if the boy is not with me, lest I see the evil that will find my father?

## Chapter 45

**1** And Joseph could no longer restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, “Cause every man to go out from me.” And no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
**2** And he lifted up his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
**3** And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph; is my father still alive?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, for they were terrified at his presence.
**4** And Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” And they came near. And he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.”
**5** And now, do not be grieved, and do not be angry with yourselves that you sold me here, for God sent me before you for preservation of life.
**6** For these two years the famine has been in the midst of the land, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
**7** And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the land, and to keep you alive for a great deliverance.
**8** And now, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
**9** Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, “Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay.”
**10** And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your sons and your sons’ sons, and your flock and your herd, and all that you have.
**11** And I will provide for you there, for there are still five years of famine, lest you be impoverished, you and your household, and all that is yours.
**12** And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my own mouth that is speaking to you.
**13** And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.
**14** And he fell upon the neck of Benjamin his brother and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
**15** And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them, and after that his brothers talked with him.
**16** And the report was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
**17** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go, return to the land of Canaan.’”
**18** And take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.
**19** And you are commanded, Do this: take for yourselves from the land of Egypt wagons for your little ones and for your wives, and you shall carry your father and come.
**20** And let your eye not pity your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
**21** And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and he gave them provision for the way.
**22** To all of them he gave each man changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.
**23** And to his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys carrying of the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys carrying grain and bread and provision for his father for the journey.
**24** So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, “Do not be agitated on the way.”
**25** And they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.
**26** And they told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart grew numb, for he did not believe them.
**27** And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph which he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, and the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
**28** And Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”

## Chapter 46

**1** And Israel set out with all that belonged to him, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
**2** And God said to Israel in visions of the night, and He said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And He said, “Here I am.”
**3** And he said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.”
**4** I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you up again, and Joseph shall lay his hand upon your eyes.
**5** Then Jacob arose from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
**6** And they took their livestock and their possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.
**7** his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt
**8** And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
**9** And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
**10** And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of the Canaanite woman.
**11** And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
**12** And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
**13** And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Job, and Shimron.
**14** And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
**15** These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, and Dinah his daughter. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
**16** And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
**17** And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
**18** These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob, sixteen souls.
**19** The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
**20** And there were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
**21** And the sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
**22** These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the persons were fourteen.
**23** And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
**24** And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
**25** These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob, all the souls were seven.
**26** All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came from his loins, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons, all the persons were sixty-six.
**27** And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two persons; all the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.
**28** And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
**29** And Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a long while.
**30** And Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.”
**31** Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.’”
**32** And the men are shepherds of flocks, for they have been men of livestock; and their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, they have brought.
**33** And it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you and says, “What is your occupation?”
**34** and you shall say, “Your servants have been men of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,” so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to Egypt.

## Chapter 47

**1** Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, and their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.”
**2** And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh.
**3** And Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds of flocks, we also and our fathers.”
**4** And they said to Pharaoh, “To sojourn in the land we have come, for there is no pasture for the flock that belongs to your servants, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
**5** And Pharaoh said to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.”
**6** The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land settle your father and your brothers. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen, and if you know that there are able men among them, then set them as rulers of livestock over what belongs to me.
**7** Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
**8** And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”
**9** And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.”
**10** And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
**11** And Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
**12** And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with bread, according to the number of the little ones.
**13** And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very severe, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
**14** And Joseph gathered all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they were buying, and Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh’s house.
**15** And the silver was spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, and all Egypt came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, and why should we die before you? For the silver is gone.”
**16** And Joseph said, “Give your livestock, and I will give to you in exchange for your livestock, if the silver has failed.”
**17** So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks of sheep, and for the herds of cattle, and for the donkeys; and he sustained them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.
**18** And that year was completed, and they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that the money is spent, and the livestock of the cattle belongs to my lord. There is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our land.”
**19** Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.
**20** And Joseph acquired all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold each his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh’s.
**21** And as for the people, he removed them to the cities, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.
**22** Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they ate their allotted portion that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
**23** Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.”
**24** And it will be, concerning the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be yours, for seed of the field and for your food, and for those who are in your households, and for food for your little ones.
**25** And they said, “You have kept us alive; let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be servants to Pharaoh.”
**26** And Joseph made it a statute to this day concerning the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh’s.
**27** And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they took possession of it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.
**28** And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
**29** And the days of Israel drew near to die, and he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal with me in kindness and truth; do not, I pray, bury me in Egypt.”
**30** and I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me up out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, “I will do according to your word.”
**31** And he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.

## Chapter 48

**1** And it came to pass after these things that someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
**2** And it was told to Jacob, and one said, “Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you.” And Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.
**3** And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.”
**4** And he said to me, Behold, I am making you fruitful and will multiply you, and I will give you for an assembly of peoples, and I will give this land to your seed after you as an everlasting possession.
**5** And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon.
**6** And your offspring that you beget after them shall be yours; by the name of their brothers they shall be called in their inheritance.
**7** As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died upon me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
**8** And Israel saw Joseph’s sons and said, “Who are these?”
**9** And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.”
**10** Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
**11** And Israel said to Joseph, “I had not thought to see your face; and behold, God has also shown me your seed.”
**12** And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground.
**13** And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them near to him.
**14** And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim, though he was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
**15** And he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has shepherded me from my existence until this day,”
**16** The Angel who redeems me from all evil, may He bless the lads; and let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them multiply abundantly in the midst of the earth.
**17** And Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.
**18** And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; put your right hand upon his head.”
**19** But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his Seed shall become the fullness of the nations.”
**20** And he blessed them that day, saying, “In you Israel will bless, saying, ‘May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’” And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
**21** And Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.”
**22** And I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

## Chapter 49

**1** Then Jacob called to his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the latter days.
**2** Gather yourselves and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to Israel your father.
**3** Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the first of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
**4** Unstable as water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your father’s bed; then you defiled it—he went up to my couch.
**5** Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of violence are their swords.
**6** Into their council may my soul not come; into their assembly may my glory not be united; for in their anger they killed a man, and in their self-will they hamstrung an ox.
**7** Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
**8** Judah, you, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; the sons of your father shall bow down to you.
**9** A lion’s cub is Judah; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness—who will rouse him?
**10** The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
**11** He ties his foal to the vine, and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he washes his garment in wine, and his robe in the blood of grapes.
**12** His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
**13** Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the seas, and he shall be a shore for ships, and his flank shall be toward Sidon.
**14** Issachar is a strong-boned donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.
**15** And he saw that rest was good, and that the land was pleasant; and he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to forced labor.
**16** Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
**17** Dan shall be a serpent by the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider falls backward.
**18** For Your salvation I have waited, O LORD.
**19** Gad, raiders shall raid him, but he shall raid at their heels.
**20** From Asher, his bread will be rich, and he will provide royal delicacies.
**21** Naphtali is a doe let loose; he gives words of beauty.
**22** Joseph is a fruitful son, a fruitful son by a spring; daughters step upon the wall.
**23** The archers bitterly attacked him, and shot at him, and hated him.
**24** But his bow remained firm, and the arms of his hands were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel.
**25** By the God of your father, who will help you, and by the Almighty, who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
**26** The blessings of your father surpass the blessings of my progenitors, up to the desire of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the one set apart from his brothers.
**27** Benjamin is a ravening wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, and at evening he divides the spoil.
**28** All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them; each one according to his blessing he blessed them.
**29** Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am being gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite.”
**30** in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial place.
**31** There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
**32** the field and the cave that is in it, from the sons of Heth.
**33** And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he drew his feet up into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.

## Chapter 50

**1** Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him.
**2** And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel.
**3** And forty days were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of embalming; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
**4** When the days of his weeping were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,”
**5** My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying; in my grave that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” So now, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will return.
**6** And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
**7** So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.
**8** and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father’s house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
**9** And there also went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and the camp was very great.
**10** And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and heavy lamentation, and he made mourning for his father seven days.
**11** And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanite, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, and they said, “This is a grievous mourning for Egypt.” Therefore its name was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
**12** And his sons did for him so, just as he had commanded them.
**13** And his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
**14** Then Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
**15** When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears hatred against us and surely returns to us all the evil that we repaid to him?”
**16** And they commanded Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying,”
**17** “Thus you shall say to Joseph, ‘Please, I beg you, forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they dealt evil to you.’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
**18** And his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
**19** Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?”
**20** As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, in order to bring about, as it is this day, to keep many people alive.
**21** So now do not be afraid; I myself will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.
**22** And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s house, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
**23** And Joseph saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation; also the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.
**24** Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you and will bring you up from this land to the land that He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
**25** And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
**26** So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
