{"ref": "ECCL 8:5", "translation": "Whoever keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing, and the wise heart knows both time and judgment."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:6", "translation": "For to every purpose there is a time and a judgment, for the misery of man is great upon him."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:7", "translation": "For he does not know what shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?"}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:8", "translation": "No man has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, and there is no authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war, and wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it."}

{"ref": "ECCL 8:10", "translation": "So I saw the wicked buried and coming and going, and from the holy place they would walk, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done; this also is vanity."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:11", "translation": "Because sentence against an evil deed is not carried out swiftly, therefore the heart of the children of man is fully set in them to do evil."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:12", "translation": "Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his days, yet I also know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:13", "translation": "But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:14", "translation": "There is a vanity that is done upon the earth: that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:15", "translation": "So I commended joy, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice, and this will accompany him in his toil all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun."}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:16", "translation": "When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth—for even by day and by night one’s eyes see no sleep—"}
{"ref": "ECCL 8:17", "translation": "And I saw all the work of God, that man is not able to find out the work that is done under the sun; because however much a man labors to seek it out, he shall not find it, and even though the wise man claims to know, he is not able to find it."}
{"ref": "ECCL 9:1", "translation": "For all this I laid to heart, and to search out all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man does not know; all lies before them."}
{"ref": "ECCL 9:2", "translation": "All things come alike to all: one event happens to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the pure and to the unclean, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice; as the good, so is the sinner; he who swears is as he who fears an oath."}
{"ref": "ECCL 9:3", "translation": "This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one event happens to all; and also the heart of the children of man is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead."}
{"ref": "ECCL 9:4", "translation": "For whoever is joined to all the living, there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion."}
