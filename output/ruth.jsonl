{"ref": "RUTH 1:1", "translation": "And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a man went from Bethlehem of Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:2", "translation": "And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. And they came into the fields of Moab and remained there."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:3", "translation": "Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:4", "translation": "And they took for themselves Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth, and they dwelt there about ten years."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:5", "translation": "And both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two sons and without her husband."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:6", "translation": "Then she arose, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the fields of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the LORD had visited His people to give them bread."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:7", "translation": "So she went out from the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:8", "translation": "And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each woman to her mother’s house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me."}

{"ref": "RUTH 1:10", "translation": "And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:11", "translation": "But Naomi said, Return, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be husbands for you?"}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:12", "translation": "Return, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to belong to a man. Even if I said, “I have hope,” even if I were to belong to a man tonight, and even if I were to bear sons,"}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:13", "translation": "Would you therefore wait for them till they are grown? Would you therefore shut yourselves off from having a husband? No, my daughters; for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD has gone out against me."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:14", "translation": "And they lifted up their voice and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:15", "translation": "And she said, Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:16", "translation": "But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back from following after you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:17", "translation": "Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and more also, for only death shall part me from you."}

{"ref": "RUTH 1:21", "translation": "I went out full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?"}
{"ref": "RUTH 1:22", "translation": "So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the fields of Moab; and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:1", "translation": "Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a mighty man of valor, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:2", "translation": "And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”"}

{"ref": "RUTH 2:4", "translation": "And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The LORD be with you.” And they said to him, “The LORD bless you.”"}

{"ref": "RUTH 2:6", "translation": "And the young man who stood over the reapers answered and said, “She is a Moabite young woman who returned with Naomi from the fields of Moab.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:7", "translation": "And she said, “Let me now glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.” So she came and has continued from the morning until now; she has rested in the house but a little."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:8", "translation": "Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Do you not hear, my daughter? Do not go to glean in another field, nor pass on from here, but stay close to my young women.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:9", "translation": "Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men draw."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:10", "translation": "Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:11", "translation": "And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully told to me all that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not know before."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:12", "translation": "The LORD repay your work, and may your reward be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:13", "translation": "And she said, I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken to the heart of your maidservant, though I am not as one of your maidservants."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:14", "translation": "And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her parched grain, and she ate and was satisfied, and had some left over."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:15", "translation": "And she rose to glean; and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not put her to shame.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:16", "translation": "And also you shall surely pull out for her some from the bundles, and leave it for her to glean, and you shall not rebuke her."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:17", "translation": "So she gleaned in the field until evening, and she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:18", "translation": "She lifted it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out and gave to her what she had left after she was satisfied."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:19", "translation": "And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you glean today, and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed. And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and she said, The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:20", "translation": "And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us; he is one of our redeemers."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:21", "translation": "And Ruth the Moabitess said, He also said to me, You shall keep close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:22", "translation": "And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that they do not meet with you in any other field."}
{"ref": "RUTH 2:23", "translation": "So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest, and she dwelt with her mother-in-law."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:1", "translation": "Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:2", "translation": "And now, is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you have been? Behold, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:3", "translation": "Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your garments upon you, and go down to the threshing floor; do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:4", "translation": "And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he lies; and you shall go in and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what you shall do."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:5", "translation": "And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:6", "translation": "So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:7", "translation": "And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry; and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and lay down."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:8", "translation": "And it came to pass at midnight, that the man trembled and turned himself; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:9", "translation": "And he said, “Who are you?” And she said, “I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your wing over your servant, for you are a redeemer.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:10", "translation": "And he said, “Blessed are you of the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first, in that you did not go after the young men, whether poor or rich.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:11", "translation": "And now, my daughter, do not fear; all that you say I will do for you, for all the gate of my people knows that you are a woman of valor."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:12", "translation": "And now indeed it is true that I am a redeemer; yet there is also a redeemer nearer than I."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:13", "translation": "Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will redeem you, well, let him redeem; but if he does not delight to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until the morning."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:14", "translation": "And she lay at his feet until the morning, and she arose before one man could recognize another. And he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:15", "translation": "And he said, “Bring the cloak that is upon you, and hold it.” And she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it upon her, and she went into the city."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:16", "translation": "And she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:17", "translation": "And she said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said to me, ‘You shall not go empty to your mother-in-law.’”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 3:18", "translation": "And she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest unless he has finished the matter this day."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:1", "translation": "Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by. So he said, “Turn aside, sit down here, my friend.” And he turned aside and sat down."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:2", "translation": "And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they sat down."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:3", "translation": "And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “The portion of the field that was our brother Elimelech’s Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, has sold.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:4", "translation": "And I said, I will uncover your ear, saying, Buy it in the presence of those who sit here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem; but if you will not redeem, tell me, that I may know, for there is none besides you to redeem it, and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:5", "translation": "Then Boaz said, On the day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:6", "translation": "And the redeemer said, “I am not able to redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. Redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I am not able to redeem it.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:7", "translation": "Now this was formerly the custom in Israel concerning redemption and concerning exchange, to confirm every matter: a man would draw off his sandal and give it to his neighbor, and this was the attestation in Israel."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:8", "translation": "So the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” and he drew off his sandal."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:9", "translation": "And Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:10", "translation": "And also Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have acquired for myself to be a wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses this day."}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:11", "translation": "And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and like Leah, who together built up the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem.”"}
{"ref": "RUTH 4:12", "translation": "And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, from the seed that the LORD shall give you from this young woman."}
