{"ref": "MAT 25:11", "kjv": "Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:12", "kjv": "But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:13", "kjv": "Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:14", "kjv": "For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:15", "kjv": "And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."}

{"ref": "MAT 25:18", "kjv": "But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:19", "kjv": "After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:20", "kjv": "And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:21", "kjv": "His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:22", "kjv": "He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:23", "kjv": "His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:24", "kjv": "Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:"}
{"ref": "MAT 25:25", "kjv": "And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine."}
{"ref": "MAT 25:26", "kjv": "His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:"}
